## ABSTRACT

Abstract 

In the event of a natural or man-made disaster, The proposed app allows rescue organisations to register and show the location of other emergency relief agencies. The proposed application works during three phases of the disasters: before, during & after the disaster. Furthermore, it uses ‘LoRa technology’ to ensure uninterrupted functionality, even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Before the disaster, disaster will be predicted through Random Forest which is a supervised algorithm, both classification and regression, known for its ability to handle complex data and provide accurate predictions, is selected as the core predictive tool. The precaution measures will be passed through our application which handles multimodal data according to the type of disasters. Emergency helpline numbers will be given and the location of the rescue homes will also be shared, so the people of the disaster zone can move to a safe place. During the disasters, the proposed app acts as a hub, connecting all the rescue agencies, sharing their location, so that immediate actions would be taken by rescue teams. After the disaster, we would also find the lost people, their photos and locations are shared so the rescue team can identify and locate them. In the area of limited network or no internet regions, the enhanced mechanism by integrating LoRa along with Mesh Topology is used. If a single pathway fails the enhanced mechanism can convey the message through other pathways. The locations and the kind of disaster can be shared immediately to the rescue teams via an enhanced mechanism that takes place even in the absence of the internet. The ultimate outcome of the proposed system is an accurate and timely prediction system that will enable disaster management authorities to take proactive measures to minimise the impact of natural disasters. This research serves as a promising step toward more resilient and efficient disaster management in an increasingly vulnerable world.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT


Natural disasters, like earthquakes, floods, landslides can displace communities, cause injuries, and destroy homes, leading to suffering, loss of life, psychological trauma, and environmental damage, impacting people's health and well-being. Disasters are crucial, taking away many lives and leaving us with a huge amount of loss. Stopping a natural disaster is not possible, but one can be prepared to face the disaster. Precautions and preparedness is a key to protect people from the disaster. One must be able to protect people even in the rural areas, hill stations, and mountain regions where network, internet connection will not be available as it is in urban areas. Our proposed solution will rescue people from the disaster, helping them to reach a safe place even before the disaster takes place, connecting the rescue teams and other rescue agencies at the time of disaster making it easy for the rescue team to gather the resources, and to get help. Even after the disaster it helps in locating people to their families. This can be done even in the absence of network. Disaster management project solutions also indirectly benefit the general public by improving preparedness, reducing response times, and minimizing the impact of disasters.

## SPECIFIC AUDIENCE

1. Disaster prone areas:
This project is useful for people living in disaster prone areas. 

2. Emergency Response Agencies:
Rescue teams, agencies and organizations responsible for disaster response coordination and relief.

3. Rural areas & areas which has weak network:
Even in the absence of the internet, our proposed solution will transfer the data, and help to gather the rescue team agents during the disaster. 

4. Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs):
NGOs specialising in disaster relief and humanitarian aid. Environmental organizations working on disaster prevention and response.

5. Health department:
Public health organizations can use the system to better prepare for health-related aspects of disaster response.
